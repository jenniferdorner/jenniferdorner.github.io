                    <h2>JENNIFER DORNER</h2>
                    <p>Jennifer Dorner was born in Victoria, British Columbia. She received her BFA from the University of Ottawa, and MFA from the University of Western Ontario, successfully defending her thesis on September 11th 2001. The harsh, terrifying reality of that day was in sharp contrast to the calm, amusing, escapist installation in the gallery. The theme of 'fleeing unrest' has continued to evolve in Jennifer's work over the past decade. She spent time in Halifax, Nova Scotia as the Director of Eyelevel Gallery from 2003 – 2005, which is where she began to paint. Now based in Montreal, Quebec, Jennifer is pursuing her artistic career, which is very much separate but influenced by current politics and the rapid decline of the world in general.</p>
                    
                    <p>Jennifer is the recipient of several grants and awards. In 2004, she was short-listed for the Atlantic region for the RBC National Painting competition. Her work has been supported by the Ontario Arts Council, the Canada Council for the Arts, SODEC and the Conseil des arts et des letters du Quebec. Her paintings have been exhibited in solo and group exhibitions across Canada. She has taught at the University of Western Ontario, Dundas Valley School of Art and has a strong passion for advocating for the arts and has spent a notable amount of time on Parliament Hill.</p>
                    
                    <h2>STATEMENT</h2>
                    <p>Outer space has been a principal theme and background that has supported the narrative in my work. The premise that humankind has expanded outward is the launching pad from which other uncanny ideas spiral out. Motivated by a feeling of being disenchanted, and disillusioned by the world in which we live, I've created blueprints for future escape. Some space vessels are parade floats with greenhouses holding elaborate gardens. Some of the paintings depict living spaces, libraries, drive-in movie theatres, gardens and other familiar social spaces related to leisure/sport and entertainment.</p>
                    
                    <p>My desire to underline the uncertain future of our planet is not meant as an explicit activist expression but rather that these are topics that inform the narrative within my work, to present ideas around customs and traditions while exploring pictorial space in the ever-challenging field of painting. Resins and paints are layered, glazed and meticulously used, to an extent where the fictional scenarios that hover in space are grounded in a ubiquitous reality, highlighting psycho-cultural tendencies in the world. The viewer is invited to be an anthropologist of this highly constructed universe.</p>
